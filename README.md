# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Initial setup 
=============================
cd my-wave-portal
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat

For Sample project - npx hardhat 


npx hardhat accounts - strings generated by hardhat to stimulate real users on blockchain
npx hardhat compile - To compile
npx hardhat test - To Test

Delete un necessary starter code 
- file sample-test.js under test.  Also, delete sample-script.js under scripts. Then, delete Greeter.sol under contracts
================================ 

Write a smart contract in .sol file in contracts folder 

Compile it 
Deploy to local blockchain
Once deployed we can see our console log statements 

Above 3 steps => compile, deploy, execute => Write a script in scripts folder
